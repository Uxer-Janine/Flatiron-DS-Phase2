    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll test our SQL skills against some real-world interview questions from major companies!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write SQL queries to filter and order results\n",
    "* Decide and perform whichever type of join is best for retrieving desired data\n",
    "* Write subqueries to decompose complex queries\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll see four different interview questions that test your SQL knowledge. We didn't write these questions -- instead, we found them out in the real-world. These are questions that have been used in the past by major technology companies such as Facebook, Amazon, and Twitter. Our goal here isn't to memorize the questions or anything like that -- after all, it's extremely unlikely that these questions are still in use, now that they've become publicly available on the interwebs. Instead, our goal is to treat these questions as if they are the real thing, and give us some insight into the types of questions we'll need to be able to answer in order pass an interview involving SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Note on Answering These Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Since these are interview questions, they'll almost always be posed as hypotheticals. This means that you won't have a real database to work with and test your code on. This also means that there are multiple different solutions to any given problem listed here. Be sure to doublecheck the code you write for bugs and errors. It's much harder to write bug-free code when you aren't able to test it against a database!\n",
    "\n",
    "If these questions seem hard, that's normal. These are real questions that have been reported to online forums from job seekers at major companies. Obviously, it's unlikely that they're still in use at these companies, but they still represent a great way for us to test our skills against the kinds of questions we can expect to be asked in an interview!\n",
